//	Approach
//	We can find the last price before 2019-08-16 for products whose price has been changed on or before this date simply by using:
//
//	select product_id, new_price as price from Products where (product_id,change_date) in (select product_id , max(change_date) as date from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' group by product_id)
//	But, problem arises for the other product_id which do not have price change on or before this date. So we find those product_id and set their price as 10 using:
//
//	select distinct product_id, 10 as price from Products where product_id not in(select distinct product_id from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' )
//	The final answer is union of these queries.
//
//	Code
//	select distinct product_id, 10 as price from Products where product_id not in(select distinct product_id from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' )
//	union 
//	select product_id, new_price as price from Products where (product_id,change_date) in (select product_id , max(change_date) as date from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' group by product_id)

	
	
	
//	select distinct product_id, 10 as price from Products where product_id not in(select distinct product_id from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' )
//	union 
//	select product_id, new_price as price from Products where (product_id,change_date) in (select product_id , max(change_date) as date from Products where change_date <='2019-08-16' group by product_id)
